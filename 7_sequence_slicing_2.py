# Difficulty Level: Beginner

# Question: List slicing is important in various data manipulation activities.
# Let's do a few more exercises on that.

# Please complete the script so that it prints out the first three items of list
# letters.

# letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

# Expected output:
# ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Hint: You can do that with letters[0:3] , but there's even a shorter way to
# do that.

# Program
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]
print(letters[:3])

# Output
# shubhamvaishnav:python-bootcamp$ python3 7_sequence_slicing_2.py
# ['a', 'b', 'c']
